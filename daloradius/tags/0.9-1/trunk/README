   daloRADIUS version 0.9-1 stable release
  by Liran Tal of Enginx <liran@enginx.com>
 ===========================================



About
=====

 daloRADIUS is an advanced RADIUS web management application aimed at managing hotspots and 
 general-purpose ISP deployments. It features user management, graphical reporting, accounting, 
 a billing engine and integrates with GoogleMaps for geo-locating.

 daloRADIUS is written in PHP and JavaScript and utilizes a MySQL database. 
 It is based on a FreeRADIUS deployment with MySQL serving as the backend.
 Among other features it implements ACLs, GoogleMaps integration for locating 
 hotspots/access points visually and many more features.



Release Notes
=============

 0.9-1 version mark some very big changes in the concept of how daloRADIUS is
 working from the developer point of view - alot of the code has been reduced
 and duplicates have been almost completely removed in order to move to a very
 dynamic code which is later adoptable easily by other developers and to
 allow comfortable addition of features upon existing codes without having
 constraints of some sort.

 Some of the important features and changes introduced are:

  * Dynamic support for attributes when adding/editing users
  * Logging capabilities allow three levels of logging facilities
  * Language support (a more complete version)
  * Introduced new interface configuration pages

 

Credits
=======

 daloRADIUS makes use of several third-party packages and I would like to thank these
 great tools and their authors for releasing such a good software to the community.

 datepicker PHP class	- Stefan Gabos <ix at nivelzero dot ro>
 libchart PHP class		- Jean-Marc Trémeaux <jm dot tremeaux at gmail dot com>
 
 Obsolete libraries:
 These graphical libraries for drawing charts were used in previous
 version, prior to 0.9 and so their credit remains:

 libgraph		- http://www.gerd-tentler.de/tools/phpgraphs/
 jpgraph		- http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/
